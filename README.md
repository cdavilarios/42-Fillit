# 42-Fillit
Group project to fill a box with a number of shapes called Tetriminos. 

The goal is to find the optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be necessary to arrange the Tetriminos among themselves and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.

My partner Zach and me worked together for three weeks in this project.
